	Recently, Amazon released that prime members would be allowed up backup unlimited photo's to their cloud network. This tool is so iPhoto users can consolidate all photos from iPhoto into a singular directory to be copied to Amazon cloud. The tool searches for .jpg images and then copies them with meta data and renames them so there will be no repeat photo names. The name is a sequential number from 1 to n string concatinated with ".JPG". Read over the code before using and make sure to input the correct directories for source and destination.
